    description: "Memecoins are here to stay and Shibu Inu is the new Dogecoin. Dogecoin is a fork (carbon copy) of Litecoin code. It runs on it's own network. Even though it is wildly popular, the coin does nothing and contributes no value to society besides being a store of value.",
    description2: "Shibu Inu is the shiny new crypto with one massive advantage. It is an ERC-20 Token. This means all of Shibu Inu takes place withing the ethereum network. It also means SHIB can interact with any other program that exists on ethereum, which gives it an instant ecosystem. It can interact with exchanges, nfts, DAO's, and more.",
    description3: "Since SHIB runs on ethereum it will benefit from any upgrades to the ethereum network automatically, compared to doge coin, which has virtually no developers or development.",
    description4: "P.S. Yes, I know Elon Musk tweeted he was talking with developers to make dogecoin orders of magnitude cheaper and faster, don't believe everything you read on the internet. He's trying to make a profit as well.",

    description: "The price of bitcoin and ethereum is published by private websites called exchanges. They report a price by calculating supply vs demand based on sellers and buyers. There's just one problem.",
    description2: "The exchanges do not accurately report supply vs demand, and are unregulated especially outside the US. When a large financial investor comes to an exchange such as Coinbase and wants to buy $20 million worth of bitcoin the demand vs supply is increasing. However, the price does not move because Coinbase doesn't put the $20 million on the orderbooks, they sell it off the books without changing the price.",
    description3: "This practice is common, and is actually how bitcoin was origiannly intended to be used before exchanges became the self appointed officials of crypto. It has the advantage of big players being able to get into the game, with the disadvantage of keeping the bitcon 'price' artificially low.",
    description4: "Long Story Short, bitcoin is worth much more than the listed price. But the best way to come to this conclusion is to understand the fundamentals.",
